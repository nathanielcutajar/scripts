# Introduction

This repo is only meant to store short scripts that may help in automation in different parts of my workflow. Scripts may be done in different languages, and may also be moved out of this repository should the script become large enough.

# TODO

* Get latest code and switch to build for all repos in a given folder
* Update POM dependencies (through internal projects and Maven)
* Clone all projects that are visible to a developer
* Change profile picture for all sites (must be able to choose which sites)
